st - simple terminal
---

- st is a simple terminal emulator for X which sucks less, and  this is my implementation of st.

### hotkeys reminder and currently applied patches:
- [X] gruvbox color scheme 
- [X] scrolling with keybinding, shift+pageUP/pageDown keyboard
- [X] scrolling with mouse, shift+up/down keypad
- [X] clipboard, in selection will copy!


#### todo:
- [ ] vim like keys...
- [ ] handle the dellkey !, the regular patch just replace it with BS
